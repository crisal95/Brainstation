                        <p>
                            HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide
                            Web. It is
                            the fifth and latest major version of HTML that is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
                            recommendation.
                            The current specification is known as the HTML Living Standard and is maintained by a
                            consortium of
                            the major browser vendors (Apple, Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft), the Web Hypertext
                            Application
                            Technology Working Group (WHATWG).

                            HTML5 was first released in public-facing form on 22 January 2008,[3] with a major update
                            and "W3C
                            Recommendation" status in October 2014.[2][4] Its goals were to improve the language with
                            support
                            for the latest multimedia and other new features; to keep the language both easily readable
                            by
                            humans and consistently understood by computers and devices such as web browsers, parsers,
                            etc.,
                            without XHTML's rigidity; and to remain backward-compatible with older software. HTML5 is
                            intended
                            to subsume not only HTML 4 but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2 HTML.[5]

                            HTML5 includes detailed processing models to encourage more interoperable implementations;
                            it
                            extends, improves and rationalizes the markup available for documents and introduces markup
                            and
                            application programming interfaces (APIs) for complex web applications.[6] For the same
                            reasons,
                            HTML5 is also a candidate for cross-platform mobile applications, because it includes
                            features
                            designed with low-powered devices in mind.

                            Many new syntactic features are included. To natively include and handle multimedia and
                            graphical
                            content, the new &lt;video&gt;, &lt;audio&gt; and &lt;canvas&gt; elements were added, and
                            support
                            for
                            scalable vector
                            graphics (SVG) content and MathML for mathematical formulas was also added. To enrich
                            the semantic content of documents, new page structure elements such as &lt;main&gt;,
                            &lt;section&gt;
                            , &lt;article&gt;, &lt;header&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, &lt;aside&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, and
                            &lt;figure&gt;
                            are added. New
                            attributes were introduced, some elements and attributes
                            were removed, and others such as &lt;a&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;, and &lt;menu&gt;
                            were changed, redefined, or standardized.
                            The APIs and Document Object Model (DOM) are
                            now fundamental parts of the HTML5
                            specification,[6] and HTML5 also better
                            defines the processing for any invalid
                            documents.[7]

                    The Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG) began work on the new standard in
                    2004. At that time, HTML 4.01 had not been updated since 2000,[8] and the World Wide Web Consortium
                    (W3C) was focusing future developments on XHTML 2.0. In 2009, the W3C allowed the XHTML 2.0 Working
                    Group's charter to expire and decided not to renew it.[9]

                    The Mozilla Foundation and Opera Software presented a position paper at a World Wide Web Consortium
                    (W3C) workshop in June 2004,[10] focusing on developing technologies that are backward-compatible
                    with existing browsers,[11] including an initial draft specification of Web Forms 2.0. The workshop
                    concluded with a vote—8 for, 14 against—for continuing work on HTML.[12] Immediately after the
                    workshop, WHATWG was formed to start work based upon that position paper, and a second draft, Web
                    Applications 1.0, was also announced.[13] The two specifications were later merged to form
                    HTML5.[14] The HTML5 specification was adopted as the starting point of the work of the new HTML
                    working group of the W3C in 2007.

                    WHATWG's Ian Hickson (Google) and David Hyatt (Apple) produced W3C's first public working draft of
                    the specification on 22 January 2008.[3]

                    <h3>"Thoughts on Flash"</h3>
                    <p>While some features of HTML5 are often compared to Adobe Flash, the two technologies are very
                        different. Both include features for playing audio and video within web pages, and for using
                        Scalable Vector Graphics. However, HTML5 on its own cannot be used for animation or
                        interactivity – it must be supplemented with CSS3 or JavaScript. There are many Flash
                        capabilities that have no direct counterpart in HTML5 (see Comparison of HTML5 and Flash).
                        HTML5's interactive capabilities became a topic of mainstream media attention around April
                        2010[15][16][17][18] after Apple Inc.'s then-CEO Steve Jobs issued a public letter titled
                        "Thoughts on Flash" in which he concluded that "Flash is no longer necessary to watch video or
                        consume any kind of web content" and that "new open standards created in the mobile era, such as
                        HTML5, will win".</p>

                    <p>On 14 February 2011, the W3C extended the charter of its HTML Working Group with clear milestones
                        for HTML5. In May 2011, the working group advanced HTML5 to "Last Call", an invitation to
                        communities inside and outside W3C to confirm the technical soundness of the specification. The
                        W3C developed a comprehensive test suite to achieve broad interoperability for the full
                        specification by 2014, which was the target date for recommendation.[23] In January 2011, the
                        WHATWG renamed its "HTML5" specification HTML Living Standard. The W3C nevertheless continued
                        its project to release HTML5.[24]</p>

                    advancing them as separate specifications. Some technologies that were originally defined in HTML 5
                    itself are now defined in separate specifications:

                    <h3>Markup</h3>
                    <p>HTML 5 introduces elements and attributes that reflect typical usage on modern websites. Some of
                        them are semantic replacements for common uses of generic block (&lt;div&gt;) and inline
                        (&lt;span&gt;)
                        elements, for example &lt;nav&gt; (website navigation block), &lt;footer&gt; (usually referring
                        to
                        bottom of web page or to last lines of HTML code), or &lt;audio&gt; and &lt;video&gt;
                        instead of &lt;object&gt;.[81][82][83] Some deprecated elements from HTML 4.01
                        have been dropped, including purely presentational elements such as
                        &lt;font&gt; and &lt;center&gt;, whose effects have long been superseded by the
                        more capable Cascading Style Sheets.[84] There is also a
                        renewed emphasis on the importance of DOM scripting in Web
                        behavior. </p>

                        (APIs) that can be used with JavaScript.[91] Existing Document Object Model (DOM) interfaces are
                        extended and de facto features documented. There are also new APIs, such as:

                    <p>XML documents must be served with an XML Internet media type (often called "MIME type") such as
                        application/xhtml+xml or application/xml,[91] and must conform to strict, well-formed syntax of
                        XML. XHTML 5 is simply XML-serialized HTML 5 data (that is, HTML 5 constrained to XHTML's strict
                        requirements, e.g., not having any unclosed tags), sent with one of XML media types. HTML that
                        has been written to conform to both the HTML and XHTML specifications and therefore produces the

                        Although HTML 5 now defines a consistent behavior for "tag soup" documents, those documents are
                        not regarded as conforming to the HTML 5 standard.</p>

                    Industry players including the BBC, Google, Microsoft, Apple Inc. have been lobbying for the
                    inclusion of Encrypted Media Extensions (EME),[124][125][126][127][128] a form of digital rights
                    management (DRM), into the HTML 5 standard. As of the end of 2012 and the beginning of 2013, 27
                    organisations[129] including the Free Software Foundation[130] have started a campaign against
                    including digital rights management in the HTML 5 standard.[131][132] However, in late September
                    2013, the W3C HTML Working Group decided that Encrypted Media Extensions, a form of DRM, was "in
                    scope" and will potentially be included in the HTML 5.1 standard.[133][134] WHATWG's "HTML Living
                    Standard" continued to be developed without DRM-enabled proposals.
